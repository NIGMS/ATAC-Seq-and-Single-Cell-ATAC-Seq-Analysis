[{"name": "Advantages of scATACseq", "front": "Benefits of single-cell ATAC-seq compared to bulk ATAC-seq", "back": "Single-cell ATAC-seq enables the study of highly heterogeneous samples, identifying unique subpopulations of cell types based on their open chromatin profiles. Bulk ATAC-seq can only provide an average readout of open chromatin from your sample, potentially masking this cellular heterogeneity."}]
