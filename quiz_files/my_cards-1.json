Minor subpopulations can be hard to detect unless deeper sequencing is performed <br> 2. scATAC-seq makes it possible to map regulomes in individual cells <br>"}, {"name": "Advantages of ATAC-seq", "front": "Tumors and tissues in different developmental states, containing multiple subpopulations with different epigenomic profiles can be identified", "back": "ATAC-seq captures all open chromatin regions, not just those bound by a specific factor. It is an unbiased (genome-wide) approach to look for epigenetic changes in a sample."}]
