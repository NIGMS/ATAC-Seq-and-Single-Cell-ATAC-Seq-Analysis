      {
        "answer": "No ATAC-seq peaks of interest",
        "correct": false,

        "answer": "Lesser number of genes",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Not quite. There are about 37 genes participating in both nucleus and mitohondria."

        "answer": "Lack of chromatin packaging",
        "correct": true,
        "feedback": "Yes. The mitochondrial genome is not enveloped, and is not packaged into chromatin."

        "answer": "Lack of protein-coding genes",
        "correct": false,
        "feedback": "Not quite. The mitochondrial genome contains 37 genes that encode 13 proteins, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs."
