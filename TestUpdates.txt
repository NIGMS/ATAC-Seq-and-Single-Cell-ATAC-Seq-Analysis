OUTSTANDING SM4: 
- little to no colored box usage as shown in workshop 9
- reinstalling cuda toolkit even though python 3 cudo 11.0 image already has it installed..install steps for rapds and cudo took 20-30 minutes which is prohibitive for students especially as we had an image with these heavy duty pre-reqs installed a few months ago
- recommend google pso/deloitte team continues to solution for custom image prior to final module release
- most of the following are already installed when you repeat this step in notebook from what we have from terminal installs:
%pip install numpy
%pip install scanpy
%pip install anndata
%pip install matplotlib
%pip install utils
%pip install rapids
- we already ran this step in the terminal '!pip install scanpy wget' don't need to run it again in notebook...it is ideal for students to keep install steps in the notebook where we can and avoid using the terminal
